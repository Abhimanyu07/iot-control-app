# iot-control-app

This is an open source contribution to the world of IoT. In this repository you will find a simple flutter app which enables you to control control your IoT devices
using basic HTTP requests easily. 
Later we hope to add other IoT protocols, like MQTT, Redis. 
We would really like your efforts to try out the project and leave feedbacks for improvements.

# How to use it?
There are two ways to do it. 
1. Build the flutter project on your system and then install the app in your smartphone. 
2. Change the branch and find the android application and over there your will have all the versions of the app with their individual readme of their specifications

There is another branch for sample esp8266 and esp32 webserver programs which you can flash on your borards.
